                        <b>The objective of this tutorial</b> is to use molecular
                        dynamics and simulate an electrolyte confined between two rigid
                        carbon walls. There are four main parts to this tutorial:
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                                <a href="#generation">System generation - </a>
                                First, the electrolyte and the
                                two walls are generated using LAMMPS internal commands.
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                <a href="#minimisation">Minimisation - </a>
                                Seconds, an energy minimisation is performed to
                                bring the system in a more favorable configuration.
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                <a href="#equilibration">System equilibration - </a>
                                Third, the system is equilibrated at a
                                pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 300 K.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="#shearing">Induced shearing - </a>
                                Finally, a shearing of the solution is induced by the 
                                motion of the two walls.
                            </li>

                        <b>Explanations:</b> The 'lattice' command defines the
                        unit cell. Here face-centered cubic (fcc) with a scale factor of 4.04 has been chosen for the future
                        positioning of the atoms of the walls.
                        The 'region' command defines a geometric region of space,
                        and by choosing 'xlo=-4' and 'xhi=4', and because we have
                        previously chosen a lattice with scale factor of 4.04,
                        the region box extends from -16.16 to 16.16 Ångström
                        (units of lengths are in Ångstrom because we have chosen the
                        unit style 'real'). Finally, the 'create_box' command creates
                        a simulation box with 5 types of atoms in the simulation:
                        oxygen and hydrogen atoms of the water, Na, Cl, and the
                        atoms of the walls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The create box command extends over 6 lines thanks to the '&'
                        character. The second and third lines are used to specify that
                        the simulation contains 1 type of bond and 1 type of angle
                        (for the water molecule). The parameters of these bond and
                        angle constraints will be given later. The three last lines
                        are for memory allocation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can now add atoms to the system. First, we create two
                        sub-regions corresponding respectively to the two solid walls,
                        and create a larger region from the union of the two regions.
                        Then we create atoms of type 5 within the two regions:.
                        <pre><code># create the walls
region rbotwall block -4 4 -4 4 -12 -10
region rtopwall block -4 4 -4 4 10 12
region rwall union 2 rbotwall rtopwall
create_atoms 5 region rwall</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <div id="boxtype1">
                        Atoms will be placed at the positions of the previously defined lattice. 
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In order to add the water molecules, we first need to
                        download the 
                        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simongravelle/lammpstutorials.github.io/main/inputs/03-NanoconfinedElectrolyte/SystemCreation/TIP4P2005.txt"
                        target="_blank" class="removelinkdefault">TIP4P2005.txt</a> file
                        and place it in the same folder. It contains all the
                        necessary information about the water molecule, such as
                        positions, bonds, and angle. Then, add the following
                        lines to input.lammps:
                        <pre><code># create the fluid
region rliquid block -4 4 -4 4 -9 9
molecule h2omol TIP4P2005.txt
lattice sc 4.04
create_atoms 0 region rliquid mol h2omol 482793</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Explanations:</b> With the last four lines,
                        a region used to deposit the
                        water is created on the last defined lattice, which is
                        'fcc 4.04'. Then, on the next line, we define
                        a new simple cubic lattice in order to position the water
                        molecules on it, with a distance of 4.04 Ångstroms between
                        each water molecule (note: the new lattice replaces the 
                        previous one as LAMMPS reads a script from top to bottom). Note 
                        that 4.04 Ångstroms is larger than
                        the typical equilibrium distance between water molecules
                        in a liquid, but this will allow us to insert ions more
                        safely. Then, the 'molecule' command opens the 'TIP4P2005.txt'
                        file, and name the associated molecule 'h2omol'.
                        Finally, molecules are created on the sc lattice by the
                        'create_atoms' command. The first parameter is '0' because
                        we use the atom id from the 'TIP4P2005.txt' file. The number
                        '482793' is a seed that is required by LAMMPS, it can
                        be any positive integer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        Finally, let us deposit 20 ions
                        (10 Na\(^+\), 10 Cl\(^-\)) in between the water molecules by adding
                        these two lines to input.01.lammps:
                        <pre><code>fix mydep1 all deposit 10 3 1 56513 region rliquid near 0.3
fix mydep2 all deposit 10 4 1 58613 region rliquid near 0.3</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each 'fix deposit' will add one ion at a random position
                        within the 'rliquid' region every timestep. So we can just
                        make a very short simulation of 10 timesteps and save
                        the generated configuration. Feel free to increase the salt
                        concentration by increasing both number of steps and number of 
                        desired ions in the 'deposit' fixes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need to define the parameters of the simulation: the mass
                        of the 6 atoms (O, H, Na\(^+\), Cl\(^-\), and wall), the pairwise interaction
                        parameters (here the parameters for the Lennard-Jones

                    It is clear from the way the system has been created that
                    the atoms are not at equilibrium distances from each others.
                    Indeed, some of the ions added using the 'fix deposit'
                    commands are too close to the water molecules. If we were
                    to start a 'normal' molecular dynamics simulation now
                    (i.e. solve the equations of motion) with a 'normal'
                    timestep (1  or 2 femto-seconds), the atoms would exert
                    huge forces on each others, accelerate brutally, and the simulation would fail (you can try).

                <p>
                To perform the energy minimization with our system, let us open a new blank
                sheet in the same folder, and rename it input.02.lammps.
                The first lines will be very similar to the previous input file:
                <pre><code># ------------- Initialisation

                units		real

                </p>
                <p>
                The only difference with input.01.lammps is that, instead
                of creating a box and atoms, we open and read the
                previously created file 'data.01.lammps' which contains
                the definition of the simulation box and the positions
                of the atoms. Next, we are going to create some groups
                with the different atom types:
                <pre><code>group		gH2O type 1 2
                group		gNa type 3
                group		gCl type 4
                group		gliquid type 1 2 3 4
                group		gtopwall type 5
                group		gbotwall type 6
                group		gwall type 5 6
                neigh_modify 	exclude group gwall gwall
                dump 		mydmp all atom 1000 dump.02.lammpstrj</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                Creating groups allows us to apply different dynamics
                to the liquid and to the walls. The 'neigh_modify'
                command asks to LAMMPS not
                to evaluate interactions between the atoms of the walls. 
                This command is used here because internal 
                deformations of the walls will not be permitted (rigid walls).
                The 'neigh_modify' command is not necessary, but save
                computation time. The last line asks LAMMPS to generate
                a dump file with the atoms positions.
                <br><br>
                Let us force the carbon walls to remain rigid
                during the simulation:
                <pre><code># ------------- run
                # ------------- walls
                fix		mysf1 gtopwall setforce 0 0 NULL
                fix		mysf2 gbotwall setforce 0 0 NULL
                fix		myaf1 gtopwall aveforce NULL NULL 0
                fix		myaf2 gbotwall aveforce NULL NULL 0</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                The first fix 'setforce' applies to the group
                'gtopwall', which contains all of the atoms of type 5.
                This fix cancels the \(x\) and \(y\) components of the forces
                applied on the atoms of the group at each timestep.
                Therefore, if these atoms have no initial
                velocity (which is the case here), they wont move along
                \(x\) anf \(y\). These fixes do nothing to the \(z\) components
                thanks to the 'NULL' keyword. The first fix 'aveforce'
                applies to the group 'gtopwall', and averages all the force
                exerted on the atoms of the group over \(z\). As a consequence,
                the atoms of the group 'gtopwall' move as a block along \(z\) 
                (and the same for the bottom wall).
                <br><br>
                Now, we can include the most important commands for the minimization:
                <pre><code>fix		mynve all nve
                compute		tliq gliquid temp
                fix		myber gliquid temp/berendsen 1 1 1
                fix_modify	myber temp tliq</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                The fix 'nve', which we apply to all atoms, performs
                constant NVE integration to update positions and velocities
                of the atoms at each timestep. The 'temp/berendsen' fix
                rescales the velocities of the atoms of the group liquid
                (ions + water) every timestep in order to reset
                the temperature. Since we want to perform a minimization
                step, both initial and final temperatures have been chosen
                equal to 1K. The third parameter is the damping factor,
                in time units, which determines how rapidly the temperature
                is relaxed. A damping factor of 1 fs would be too small
                for a molecular dynamics simulation, but is acceptable
                for a minimization step during which we just want the
                atoms to move slightly from their initial positions.
                The 'fix_modify' is used to assign the temperature of
                the group 'gliquid' as calculated by the compute 'tliq'
                to the Berendsen thermostat.
                </p>
                <p class="alert alert-info">Without this 'fix_modify',
                LAMMPS would use the measured temperature of group 'all'
                as the reference temperature when rescaling the velocities
                of the atoms of group 'gliquid', which is inconsistent.
                The simulation would still work without error message,
                but the temperature of the atoms would be different from
                the desired value.
                </p>
                <p>
                If we were to run the simulation as it is, it would fail
                because nothing maintains the shape of the water molecules
                (the bond and angle energies are equal to 0). Let us
                use the shake algorithm in order to apply bond and angle
                constraints to the water molecules. In addition, let us
                add a fix 'recenter' in order to maintain the system
                centered in the middle of the box in the \(z\) direction.
                The fix recenter has no influence on the dynamics.
                <pre><code>fix		myshk gH2O shake 1.0e-4 200 0 b 1 a 1
                fix		myrct all recenter NULL NULL INIT</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                Finally, let us choose a very small timestep
                (because we anticipate that the atoms are initially too
                close to each others) and run for 1000 timesteps (with
                the command thermo 1000, thermodynamic info are printed
                in the terminal every 1000 timesteps).
                <pre><code>timestep	0.1

                the system (fifth column) decreases toward negative values:

                If you look at the trajectory using VMD, you will see some of the atoms (the
                one that where initially in a problematic position) slightly move from each others,

                <h2>System equilibration</h2>
                <p>
                Starting from the final configuration of the minimization
                step, we can now run the molecular dynamics simulation.
                Here we are going to let the system evolve freely until it
                reaches an equilibrium. Let us create a new input file
                and call it input.03.lammps. Add the following lines:

                The two main differences with the previous step are the
                timestep (1 fs instead of 0.1 fs) and the thermostating. With
                an imposed temperature of 300 K, the fluid is expected to
                behave as a liquid. A timestep of 1 fs is classic for these
                force fields. Never use a larger timestep except if you have
                a good reason to do so. What you observe should resembles

                target="_blank">this video</a>.
                <br><br>
                The 'thermo_modify' ensures that the printed temperature 
                is the temperature of the liquid, and not the temperature 
                of the whole system which is lower (because the walls are frozen 
                and have an effective temperature of 0 K)
                </p>

                <p>
                Running the last input script is likely to take time (more than 30 minutes). You
                can speed up the calculation by running LAMMPS on multiple cores using mpirun.

                <h4><b>Exercise 1 : Extract data from the simulation</b></h4>

                <p>
                Starting from the equilibrated configuration (data.03.lammps), extract the 
                density profiles (for Na\(^+\), Cl\(^-\), and water) along the axis normal to 
                the solid walls.

                </p>

                <blockquote><i>
                Hint: data extraction can in general be done (1) using the internal LAMMPS 
                command, and (2) using a post-processing analysis tool (e.g. Python). 
                </blockquote></i>
                </p>

                <h4><b>Exercise 2 : Use fully flexible walls</b></h4>

                <p>
                Starting from the equilibrated configuration (data.03.lammps), or 
                starting from scratch, do the same using fully flexible wall instead of 
                frozen walls. Flexible walls can be thermalised, and are therefore more 
                realistic.
                <br><br>
                What you observe should resembles

                </p>

                <h4><b>Exercise 3 : Simulate the transport properties </b></h4>

                <p>
                Starting from the equilibrated configuration (data.03.lammps), induce 
                a flow of the liquid in the direction tangential to wall, and measure 
                the velocity profile. 
                </p>

                <blockquote><i>
                Advice 1: when inducing a flow in a direction \(i\), one needs to exclude 
                the degrees of freedom in the direction \(i\) from the thermalisation, 
                otherwise the resulting temperature is likely to be wrong.
                </blockquote></i>

                <blockquote><i>
                Advice 2: the forcing must be chosen with care. If too large, the system will
                be strongly out-of-equilibrium. If too small, no net velocity will be measured
                because of the noise.
                </blockquote></i>

                <p>
                Is the velocity profile you obtain consistent with Poiseuille's predictions?
